Funnel Submodule Setup 
(must have access to submodule's original repository)

- npm install
- git submodule init 
    - submodule from original repo gets registered in current working directory path
- git submodule update
    - should then clone into current working directory, and then redirect to the submodule's original repository.
    - (ensure you have access to the repository ex. dev privileges)

When successful, submodule folder should now provide access to files.
