PiBU readme here (how to start, how each service works)

Requires Node 16 and Docker (should come with `docker compose` command)
```
npm install
cp sample.env .env
cp ui/sample.ui.env ui/.env
```

Need to spin up to get values for editing the .env files.
```
make setup-volumes
make dev
```

Find `KEYCLOAK_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY` from the Keycloak console (localhost:8080) realm public key : `Realm Settings` -> `Keys` -> `Public Key`
```
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_HOST=your_local_machine_ip_from_internet_settings
KEYCLOAK_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=key_from_keycloak_admin_console
```

You may also need to change some Docker options to give your containers (specifically `api`) enough memory to run (~4gb).
